Your abstract

% This skeleton demonstrates how to use the \texttt{infthesis} style for
% undergraduate dissertations in the School of Informatics. It also emphasises the
% page limit, and that you must not deviate from the required style.
% The file \texttt{skeleton.tex} generates this document and can be used as a
% starting point for your thesis. The abstract should summarise your report and
% fit in the space on the first page.
